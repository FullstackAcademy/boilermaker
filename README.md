# Boilermaker

_Good things come in pairs_

Looking to mix up a backend with `express`/`sequelize` and a frontend with
`react`/`redux`? That's `boilermaker`!

Follow along with the boilerplate workshop to make your own! This canonical
version can serve as a reference, or a starting point. For an in depth
discussion into the code that makes up this repository, see the
[Boilermaker Guided Tour][boilermaker-yt]

## Setup

To use this as boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty
  directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on
  Github and clone it to your local machine)
* Run the following commands:

```
git remote add boilermaker https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker.git
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

Why did we do that? Because every once in a while, `boilermaker` may
be updated with additional features or bug fixes, and you can easily
get those changes from now on by entering:

```
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

## Customize

Now that you've got the code, follow these steps to get acclimated:

* Update project name and description in `package.json`
* `npm install`
* Create two postgres databases (`MY_APP_NAME` should match the `name`
  parameter in `package.json`):

```
export MY_APP_NAME=boilermaker
createdb $MY_APP_NAME
createdb $MY_APP_NAME-test
```

* By default, running `npm test` will use `boilermaker-test`, while
  regular development uses `boilermaker`
* Create a file called `secrets.js` in the project root
  * This file is listed in `.gitignore`, and will _only_ be required
    in your _development_ environment
  * Its purpose is to attach the secret environment variables that you
    will use while developing
  * However, it's **very** important that you **not** push it to
    Github! Otherwise, _prying eyes_ will find your secret API keys!
  * It might look like this:


```
process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = 'the client id'
process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = 'the client secret'
```

### OAuth


* To use OAuth with Github, register an OAUTH app with github in order to obtain client_id and client_secret, the callback url should be set to http://localhost:8080/auth/github/callback

[github-oauth]: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps 

## Start

Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)

From there, just follow your bliss.

## Deployment

Ready to go world wide? Here's a guide to deployment! It is ready to be deployed to heroku at any moment.
Supported way to deploy in Boilermaker:


### Heroku

1.  Set up the [Heroku command line tools][heroku-cli]
2.  `heroku login`
3.  Add a git remote for heroku:

[heroku-cli]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

* **If you are creating a new app...**

  1.  `heroku create` or `heroku create your-app-name` if you have a
      name in mind.
  2.  `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` to add
      ("provision") a postgres database to your heroku dyno
  3.  `heroku config:set JWT=<your secret here!>` to set a secret for JWT signing 
  4.  if you are using github oauth, you'll need to register another OAUTH app with github with the appropriate callback url and set the environment variables for GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET 

* **If you already have a Heroku app...**

  1.  `heroku git:remote your-app-name` You'll need to be a
      collaborator on the app.


Now, you should be deployed!
