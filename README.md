# Boilerplate Full Stack Application

---

Changes to be made to adapt this boilerplate as your own:
[ ] change the `name` field in package.json to match your project name
[ ] create a database with the same name as the `name` field you adapted in package.json by executing the following steps:

1.  using the `psql` command in the command line to open the postgresql shell.
1.  execute the following command at prompt:
    `CREATE DATABASE ${name};` (don't forget the semicolon!)
1.  check if the database is there by using: `\l` (no semi necessary).
    Exit the shell with `\q`
