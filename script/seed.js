Not too spicy for me but plenty good. The thick oodles are great and the sauce base is so good and plentiful. I had my first bowl with veggies on the side and I added sesame seeds.I will buy it again, but want to get it cheaper. Definitely five stars from me, but then I love good instant ramen.", rating: 4.8, userId: 1, productId: 2}),

    Review.create({body: "When it comes to these Asian noodles, i'm an expert at this point. Years and years of consumption..I eat all types of varieties 4 days a week just about. So let me tell you about the Samyang Spicy Korean Noodles. These damn noodles are so delicious. Yes they're hot, but tasty hot, addicting i'd say. It reminds me of those Flamin Hot Cheetos flavor. The sauce is like a thick chili oil that has some sweetness to it. Slight sweetness with an umami chicken thing going on, it works well to balance that burn. The noodles themselves are thicker then your normal ramen noodles, they have great chew and are of very good quality. I prepare my noodles with ground turkey and add a bunch of herbs to it for freshness. A side of veggies to counter the noodles and you're good to go. YES you will stop eating them for a minute because your lips will burn and some sweat will develop on your forehead :) What I do is make sure the noodles are wrapped around my chopsticks or fork well before going into the mouth, that way you avoid touching your lips. That's where it's at trust me. Your mouth won't burn as much as your lips will, so just do the technique i described you should be fine. THE PAIN IS WORTH THE LOVE GO FOR IT!!!!", rating: 4, userId: 2, productId: 1}),

    Review.create({body: "On another occasion, hubby and I gave Ikkoryu Fukuoka Ramen another try. I knew their broth was salty so I asked for added hot water so I could dilute the broth, but the waitstaff serving us gave us cold drinking water. Again I asked for hot water, again same girl gave us more soup,, no I said I need hot water, but she gave me tap water instead, ok I give up, i will let that slide... (management pls tell your waitstaff to LISTEN to their customers.", rating: 5, userId: 2, productId: 3}),
